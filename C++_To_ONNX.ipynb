    "To convert a machine learning model to ONNX format in a C++ environment, you'll typically need to use a tool or a library that supports exporting models from the framework you're using. Unfortunately, direct support in C++ for exporting models to ONNX is limited, so you often have to first convert models in a high-level language like Python and then use the ONNX model in C++.\n",
